## MVC Architecture

The Highlander Industries Database Application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's data and behavior, including database interactions, validations, and calculations.
- **View**: Presents the user interface to the application's users. It displays the data from the model and sends user inputs to the controller for processing.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user inputs from the view, interacts with the model to perform actions such as data retrieval or updates, and updates the view with the results.
